## Introduction

Pokemon Drawing Challenge is a Pokemon drawing game. Players have to draw a random pokemon which generated by system in a minute. If you are an authenticated player, your paintings would be stored into database. You can check them out in your personal **Drawing History** page in any time, or share them to **Public Gallery**, then every user shall see your masterpieces!

This project was written with vue3 and vite and use pinia for state management. All the pokemon data is from [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/), and I use Firebase Firestore for authentication and storing data.
